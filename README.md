# Amazon-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard


## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize Amazon sales performance using interactive Power BI dashboards. Leveraging Excel, Power BI, Power Query, DAX, and data modeling, the dashboard provides insights into sales trends, courier status, fulfillment channels, product categories, sizes, and shipping locations.
This enables businesses to monitor operations, improve delivery efficiency, optimize stock, and make data-driven decisions.

Data Collection

Gathered raw Amazon sales data including order details, product categories, shipment status, fulfillment type, sizes, and locations.

Data Wrangling & Cleaning (Power Query)

Removed duplicates & irrelevant fields

Standardized text, date, and category formats

Fixed inconsistencies in courier and fulfillment names

Addressed missing or null values

Data Modeling (Power BI)

Built relationships between tables for effective reporting

Applied star schema modeling for performance optimization

Data Analysis (DAX)

Created KPIs (Total Sales, Count by Category, Count by Courier Status, Fulfillment Method)

Developed calculated measures for tracking performance

Data Visualization (Power BI)

Designed interactive visuals showing:

Courier Status distribution

Sales by Category

Which product category generates the most sales?

Which fulfillment method (Amazon, Merchant, etc.) handles the most orders?

Which logistics partner (Ekart, Easy Ship) fulfills the majority of orders?

Which product size is most in demand?

Which states and cities have the highest order volumes?

What is the sales trend over the selected time period?
